# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. **The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.**

**You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own.** These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - We all aim to contribute equal amounts of work to the project
    - We all plan to meet all milestone deadlines
    - We all hope to communicate in a clear and timely manner through the team GroupMe
    - We all commit to respect each other's ideas but will also raise concerns/note disagreements freely
        - This helps to ensure that we do not bottle up frustrations and that we are able to produce a final product that we all love
        - Disagreements will be explained in a way that addresses how functional the idea is with potential users in mind, which may be evaluated through user testing.
    - We all promise to identify and resolve potential conflicts quickly, both with the client and within the team
    - We all hope to produce a website of exceptional quality—one that meets the needs of the audience and exceeds the client’s expectations
        - This will, in turn, help us earn a good grade—including an A!

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    - Every meeting, the group members will take on a set of fairly distributed tasks. If a member is unable to complete our tasks, the member should communicate that as soon as possible in the GroupMe, and ask for a “cover”- if we have something more important going on during this week (example: see priorities)
        - If we ask for a “cover” for one of our tasks, we are expected to cover someone’s work to earn it back the following week.
    - We should not talk over each other while discussing ideas.
    - We should forward email confirmation of submissions for milestones and labs to other members.
    - We should create a safe space to share ideas—one that welcomes any idea and professionally/collegially resolves disagreements.
    - Any idea that we move forward with must be acceptable (does not need to be the favorite idea) by all members.
    - Our meeting spot defaults to PSB (Physical Science Building) unless otherwise specified. If every spot is full, we go upstairs/find another place together after convening. Whoever gets here first reserves two tables and brings them together.


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    - We will communicate through our group chat in GroupMe whenever input is necessary from others. This should usually be at least once every few days.
    - We will recap our work during weekly meetings—held either over Zoom or in person at a mutually convenient location on campus—as well as labs.
    - We will select the meeting time for each week after our Friday lab session during the ten minutes we have before the next class begins. Everyone will fill out the newest When2Meet.
    - We will CC group members via email whenever we communicate with the client.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    - By email and during at least three scheduled Zoom meetings.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**NO "CODER" OR "DESIGNER" ROLES!**)

    - Minute Taker (rotating job) — Types meeting notes in Google Docs and makes the When2Meet to schedule the following week's meeting.
    - Agenda Checker (George) —  Reminds every member (through the GroupMe app) of major deadlines, thus ensuring timely completion. Check in with everyone if they are not completing their job in time and find new solutions.
    - Quality Checker/Proofreader  (Phyllis and Tairan) — a person who checks every source, makes sure that every source is reliable and accurate, and ensures that every source is cited correctly.
        - Also looks over each submission before it’s submitted.
    - Client Communicator (Tairan)— the person who emails the client and sets up Zoom meetings on a regular basis, giving updates to the group.
    - Illustrator (Anika, Phyllis, and Kai) — creates original content for the website through photo-editing and graphics-designing apps.
    - Themer (Kai, Anika, and Phyllis) — maintains documentation (.md file) about the website’s theme guide (colors, fonts, etc.) and purpose after group decisions. Does NOT design the layout of the website. Helps unify the group's theme within their respective web-pages.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    - We will note started and completed tasks in the weekly meeting’s Google Drive document.
    - We will discuss contributions during the weekly meetings and take stock of the distribution of work.
    - If someone fails to deliver what was promised they will be contacted privately by George and be given a grace period of one day.
        - If the job is still not completed by the grace period’s end, an official tally will be taken and noted during the meeting. We will then try to parse through the reasons for the tardy work and discuss potential ways to avoid future late work and to complete the work by redistributing it among group members.
        - At the end of the semester, if a member’s tally is greater than two, their tardy work may be noted on peer evaluations (and they will also have to buy everyone bubble milk tea).

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - If we disagree, we will explain points in a way that addresses how functional the idea is for our audience instead of framing it in terms of personal likes and dislikes.
    - We will do user testing to help guide our disagreement resolution.
    - We will disagree respectfully and not aggressively.
    - We will recognize that disagreements are healthy, welcomed, and even encouraged!
        - We cannot make improvements if we do not know what can be improved/cannot identify potential problems with the website.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    - We will sit down every week during the weekly meeting and ask if the contract needs revisions (can be a simple yes/no question).

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    - We will meet up for bubble tea at least once during the project.
    - We will celebrate our complete website before each feedback period.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before the instructor will intervene.
