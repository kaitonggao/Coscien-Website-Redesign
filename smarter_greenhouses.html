                            <h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
                            <p>Students will gain competencies in high-level greenhouse science and engineering and their use in meeting fundamental research goals and real-world applications. Students will demonstrate an understanding of the scientific method by developing research questions, formulating hypotheses, identifying and explaining appropriate methods, gathering and interpreting data, and reporting research findings. They will learn to write a scientific research paper, explore environmental assessments used to determine appropriate solutions, study how to perform on-the-ground research, and become well-versed in the current state of the greenhouse industry and greenhouse research.</p>

                <h3>From Students</h3>
                    <p>"Embracing genuine love for ecology and environmental protection,I have been seeking opportunities to take relevant courses and experience related research, to make preparations for my further study in this field. The Eco-solution course offers me a wonderful chance to explore the world of agriculture and ecology. The literature of high quality and online lectures expanded my knowledge reserve and the Webinar is an excellent platform where not only can I express my ideas but also I am available to others’ thoughts. What impresses me most is turning theory into practise, the research stage in which I can apply my knowledge and skills to real cases." — <em>Yingtong Zhu, senior majoring in Economics at Sun Yat-sen University</em><p>
                    <p>"I love Science and really enjoyed the Eco-Solutions: Smarter-Greenhouses course. The lectures, resource-links, slides, and webinars greatly helped me learn the content and develop my analytical and research skills. I could apply my learnings to real situations through case studies and research work in the course. My instructors were subject matter experts, who patiently clarified my questions, and were very approachable. I received a commendation letter, certificate, and tree-gift for my performance which was a great motivation. Thank you to IvyOnline academy for providing the opportunity which is valuable for my future." — <em>Priyanka Supraja Balaji, freshman at Lynbrook High School in San Jose, CA</em><p>
